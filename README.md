Programming Assignment 2-8 Create a Java method static int min(int[] arrayOfInts) (in a class Prog2_8) 
that outputs the minimum of an array of ints. Create a class Prog2_8Test that tests your method on the following input array

[2, -21, 3, 45, 0, 12, 18, 6, 3, 1, 0, -22] 

using JUnit. NOTE: 
You may not use the sorting tools available in the Java libraries; for instance, you may not call Arrays.sort() to sort the input array.
(No credit if you do it this way.)
